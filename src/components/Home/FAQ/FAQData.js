    title: "Do you provide the alcohol?",
    text: "No, our packages do not include any alcohol. You will need to purchase the alcohol from a separate vendor (store, your caterer, your venue), which will then be mixed and served by our bartenders. However, all of the prep work leading up to your alcohol purchase will be done by us--we will help you to decide what you need to order, how much you need to order, and when/where it should arrive.",

    text: 'We are able to serve at private events. This includes weddings, birthday parties, baby or bridal showers, corporate parties, fundraisers, etc. For public events, it is the responsibility of the client to secure necessary permitting. Events must not be operating as a "cash bar", as we are unable to sell alcohol from our bar.',
